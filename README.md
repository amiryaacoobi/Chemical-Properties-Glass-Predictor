This project predicts glass types for forensic investigations using the Glass Identification dataset from the mlbench R package. Employing multivariate analysis techniques, the study explores the relationships between chemical properties (e.g., RI, Na, Ba) and glass types. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction, and Random Forest and LDA models are applied to achieve high accuracy in classifying glass types, providing valuable insights for forensic science.
